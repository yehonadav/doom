--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed, all drawing modes: in some cases incorrect sector shape was constructed when updating sector shapes after drawing new lines, which resulted in nearby sectors being merged into sector(s) affected by linedefs drawing.


R2503 | 7059d26c | MaxED | 11.05.2016, 2:22
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added: when "sidedefcompressionignoresaction" property is set to false, sidedefs, which belong to a line with a non-zero action or tag, will be skipped when compressing sidedefs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed: VirtualSectorField was cleared from sector properties when pasting map geometry in Doom/Hexen map formats leading to incorrect sector assignment [I broke this in r2009, so it seems].

According to dotnetperls.com, "new Dictionary&lt;string, [anything]&gt;(StringComparer.Ordinal)" works 17% faster than "new Dictionary&lt;string, [anything]&gt;()", so let's stick that everywhere and see what happens :)
Draw Curve Mode: added settings panel.
Sectors mode: added "Make Door" button to the toolbar.

Interface: added "Draw [stuff]" buttons to modes toolbar.
Interface: reorganized main menu. Hope it makes more sense now.
API: added General.Interface.AddModesButton() and General.Interface.AddModesMenu(), which can be used to add buttons to specific group in "Modes" toolbar and menu items to specific group in "Modes" menu, so actions, which behave like an editing mode, but are not part of one can be added there.


R1791 | 21889a98 | MaxED | 21.02.2014, 18:24
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Default thing arguments were not set when creating a new thing, only when changing thing type in Edit Things window.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configurations: increased game configuration loading speed (in previous builds it took ~650 ms. to load a single game configuration, now it takes ~120 ms. to load all 64 of them). As a side effect, New\Open Map Options, Map Options and Game Configurations windows are now opened noticeably faster. The editor starts up a bit faster as well.
Configurations: all 64 game configuration are now available by default.
Game Configurations window: game configurations can now be disabled. This setting is mostly cosmetic. When a game configuration is disabled, it won't be shown in "game configuration" dropdowns in New\Open Map Options and Map Options windows. If a map's .dbs file specifies a disabled configuration, it will be picked as a map configuration anyway.
Linedefs mode: vertex insert preview logic used Highlight range instead of Stitch range (which is used when draw mode engages).
Visual mode: double-sided middle textures were not selected when using "Select" action with "with same texture" modifier.
Textures: some optimizations in patch blending code.

Some cosmetic changes in Tools and BaseVisualMode.
Updated zspecial.acs


R1781 | 1367c37b | MaxED | 03.02.2014, 14:19
